# 📢 How to Announce Your NFT Project Like a Pro: Web3 PR That Works

Launching an NFT project? 🧵 Your art or utility isn't enough you need to get the right eyeballs on it.

That’s where **PR meets Web3**.

We’ve seen too many NFT founders struggle with:
- No press coverage despite cool drops
- Twitter bots & ghost followers instead of real fans
- Zero traction on launch day

The missing link?  
📣 A **targeted, blockchain-native press release strategy.**

- **Launch timeline**  mint date, whitelist details, platform  
- **Smart contract transparency** — Etherscan verified, royalty logic  
- **Utility** roadmap, tokenomics (if any), Discord access
